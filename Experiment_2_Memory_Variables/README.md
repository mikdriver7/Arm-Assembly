# Experiment 2: Memory Variables and Linker Scripts

## Overview
This experiment focuses on memory management, linker scripts, and basic ARM assembly operations including variable declaration and memory addressing.

## Files
- **add_from_mem.s**: Demonstrates basic memory operations with byte variables
- **vector_dot_product.s**: Computes dot product of two 3-element vectors
- **linker_script.ld**: Memory partitioning configuration

## Key Concepts
- `.data` and `.text` section directives
- Memory reservation with `.byte`, `.space`
- Register indirect addressing
- Linker script memory mapping

## Results
Successfully computed vector dot product and demonstrated memory variable manipulation using GDB debugging environment.
